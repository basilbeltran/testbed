Code intended to demonstrate one or more of the following:
  - Clean, secure, object oriented PHP.
  - Usable, modern, and reasonably standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  - Clear, sensible, and consistently formatted code.
  - maintainability
using

   * HTML5 + CSS3 + Bootstrap +jQuery + MySQL + Mongo
   * noSQL stores (Varnish / Memcached / Redis / MongoDB)
   * MVC


testbed is a framework for config and testing of various 
persistence functionality as that seems to be of interest 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steps to deploy the code
1) edit ./application/config/database.php to include your MySQL instance
2) deploy dump ./testbed/testbedDump.sql
3) edit ./application/config/mongo.php

Project integration log:

1) Base framework CodeIgniter 2.1.2 supports a clean MVC implementation.
    + http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/libraries/cart.html
    + http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/libraries/sessions.html  

    + Points of interest are contained in 
        ./application/controller  (MVC)
        ./application//models     (MVC)
        ./application//views      (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, Bootstrap)
   
  routes.php (and .htaccess) controls URI navigation behavior
    + testCart as default page

2) Configuration of naked CI framework involves adding libraries and tweaking /applications/config/?
and includes:
   /system/libraries/...  
    + URLs
    + Forms
    + Cart
    + Database (SQL)
    + Redis   

   /application/libraries/...      
    + Mongo
      

3)  the /assets dir includes javascript, images, CSS, less files. 

4)  DEFAULT PERSISTENCE OPTIONS FOR THE APP AS DELIVERED
    + Sessions management = MongoDB 
    + Product management  = MySQL
    
5) header.php under application/views/include will give an idea of the state
   of the prototype and what functionality exists.

That's all for now. 
Basically the test cart and the options page.
Sessions are using Mongo.
No time to implement any Redis. bummer.
