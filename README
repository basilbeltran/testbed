    + Redis   

   /application/libraries/...      
    + Mongo
      

3)  the /assets dir includes javascript, images, CSS, less files. 

4)  DEFAULT PERSISTENCE OPTIONS FOR THE APP AS DELIVERED
    + Sessions management = MongoDB 
    + Product management  = MySQL
    
5) header.php under application/views/include will give an idea of the state
   of the prototype and what functionality exists.
